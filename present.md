# things to say

"what is a narrative driven game? just a miserable pile of stories. but enough, have at you!"

why people play games.
people play games because they are fun. we tend to play the games that are most likely to appeal to us.
I like puzzle games, brent likes mario party, some other people may like other games.

same thing with stories.
