_"what is a narrative driven game? just a miserable pile of stories. but enough, have at you!"_
-dracula 

why people play games.
people play games because they are fun. we tend to play the games that are most likely to appeal to us.
I like puzzle games, brent likes party games, we all have some sort of preference.

I think that the same is true about stories, and narrative driven games. there is a certain way that people prefer to play these games based on what they like. some people may want to play with a more action focused style, or others may play by communicating with non player characters and trying to leverage that. if someone is forced to play in a way that they do not like, they may grow bored of the game, or worse might just get stuck.

what can be done about this? well in traditional table top role playing games this really isn't an issue. there is a human there that acts as the Game Master that will work as the rest of the universe. They are able to change things on the fly so that they are are engaging the players. If the players get stuck on a puzzle the GM might make it easier. if they keep getting stuck on puzzles the GM might just use less puzzles in the future. Since the players are not aware of the fact that the world is tailor made to them they still perceive it to be realistic and enjoyable. If they knew that the world is subtly changing itself to get easier or to skip challenges they might feel that they are getting a sub-par experience. (this is also a reason as to why GM's should not tell their players how things could have happened if they did stuff differently) This isn't really the case in table top games because the story is very fluid and on the fly. but for video games their stories tend to be a lot more rigid.

In most narrative games there is more than one path to take. you can defeat the dragon through waltzing up to it and fighting, or you can try to talk to it, and use the time to steal a cup and find a weak spot. but these things are usually rigid choices. when the player is told that "you can go fight the dragon head on" or "you can sneak around". they may choose to do the thing that is the safest even if it is not the thing that they would find the most enjoyable. you can obscure these effects behind many layers of other choices (see, Witcher 3) but this is still just masking the problem, and a player playing the game again would be able to do the exact same things.

So how do we solve this problem of getting a player to do the things that they will find interesting. Drama management! Drama management takes the form of two parts: building a model of the player, and using that model to figure out what to give the player. Modeling the player can be done indirectly by what actions the player takes. If the player talks to a lot of people in the game their corresponding model may reflect that. Using that model we can then figure out what to give the player in terms of content. A player that tends to pick aggressive choices in conversation may be given the chance to be more aggressive in the future.
