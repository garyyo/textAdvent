agent we are interested in is the drama manger

ability for th game to play itself

shoudl there be a global or per quest player model

figure out which actions

player model is a list of actions and weights towards them


two systems we need
    player modeling
    picking quests based on player modeling.
        load multiple scenarios
        choose based on closest to player model


design doc?


rough map of town

whitelist is more of a required
blacklist is more of a forbidden

if you dont have a whitelist, you cant activate
if you do have a blacklist, you cant activate

it errs on the side of not activating.

mirror neurons. have a machine learn from seeing things and processing those actions as if it did them itself.

more scenarios, at 4
get player model data. at least based on how many times user does an action. get scenarios that
implement looking at items, and getting keys from that.
when to offer the quest: when the player gets bored
    when the players boredom stat goes below some threshold
how does it look like to offer the quest
    how do you make the player know there is an alternative without being too disruptive
how to choose the quest to offer.

add tags to each place so you can trigger a global "change path" event if we need to
    tag outside, player seeks action
        cat runs past into an alley, go chase
    tag outside, player just bored
        cat runs past you have chance to grab it or follow?!?

research how to update confidence. and determine the best choice.
