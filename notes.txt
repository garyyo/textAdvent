whitelist is more of a required
blacklist is more of a forbidden

if you dont have a whitelist, you cant activate
if you do have a blacklist, you cant activate

it errs on the side of not activating.

get player model data. at least based on how many times user does an action. get scenarios that

when to offer the quest: when the player gets bored
    when the players boredom stat goes below some thershold
how does it look like to offer the quest
    how do you make the player know there is an alternative without being too disruptive
how to choose the quest to offer.
