agent we are interested in is the drama manger

ability for th game to play itself

shoudl there be a global or per quest player model

figure out which actions

player model is a list of actions and weights towards them


two systems we need
    player modeling
    picking quests based on player modeling.
        load multiple scenarios
        choose based on closest to player model


design doc?


rough map of town

whitelist is more of a required
blacklist is more of a forbidden

if you dont have a whitelist, you cant activate
if you do have a blacklist, you cant activate

it errs on the side of not activating.

mirror neurons. have a machine learn from seeing things and processing those actions as if it did them itself.

G: gate
g: guild
F: starting fountain
b: babushka's house
t: tavern
m: market
c: final location of cat
a: alley that reveals itself if player is "bored"

write the story:
    get cat quest from granny
    ask around town for cat clues
    get orange cat clue from someone
        granny, neighbor, etc.
    ask about orange cat to guard.
        tells you location of the cat
        tells you person who might have seen the cat.

    find person who might have seen the cat
        get location of cat
            reveals cat in location
        get help in finding the cat.
            asks for a portion of the the reward
                if yes continue

    spooky dude meets you outside gate.

    several areas to find the cat in.
        you either have to search them all if you dont have help.
        or if you have help you only have to search one before you are given it.

story branching paths:
    if you get bored an alley appears from the market to the guild hall, the cat is just sitting there for you to scoop up.
        an event activates when your "boredom" level rises that shows the cat running into the alley
        end point branch






more scenarios, at 4
get player model data. at least based on how many times user does an action. get scenarios that
implement looking at items, and getting keys from that.
when to offer the quest: when the player gets bored
    when the players boredom stat goes below some threshold
how does it look like to offer the quest
    how do you make the player know there is an alternative without being too disruptive
how to choose the quest to offer.

add tags to each place so you can trigger a global "change path" event if we need to
    tag outside, player seeks action
        cat runs past into an alley, go chase
    tag outside, player just bored
        cat runs past you have chance to grab it or follow?!?

research how to update confidence. and determine the best choice.
